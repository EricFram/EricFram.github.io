				<p class="lead"> <a href="http://www.merge.com/">Merge Healthcare</a> - acquired by IBM for $1 billion in October 2015 - partnered with Zippy Brain to develop an app prototype to showcase at <a href="http://www.rsna.org/Annual_Meeting.aspx">RSNA 2015</a>. The goal of the app is to provide Merge's end users (physicians, technologists, and site leaders) with a single portal to interact with Merge's various services. This app acts as a route for inexpensive communication with users, incentivizes users to enroll in online learning, improves the efficiency of service requests and more. </p>
