I've been working on getting Sunny LA to run better, especially on older devices. The traffic graphics can be pretty taxing, but I think I've been able to make some pretty big improvements for this version.

Sunny LA version 1.3 is now available on the App Store.

- Significant performance improvements
- New iPad App Preview

If you haven't tried out Sunny LA, it's available for free! <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunny-la-trek-to-hollywood-hills/id1224333726?ls=1&mt=8">Download it on the App Store</a>.
