In this strategy and resource management game, you need to plan your route, manage provisions, and keep your reputation high as you travel through the endless streets, avenues, and boulevards of Los Angeles.

>> You only have until the end of the weekend to make it to the party in Hollywood Hills. Too bad you’re in Venice, 16 miles away. If you make it in time, everyone in *the industry* will see how cool you are. If you don’t, you probably aren’t going to make it in this town.
