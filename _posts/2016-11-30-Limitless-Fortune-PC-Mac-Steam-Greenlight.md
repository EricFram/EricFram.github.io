The game is currently out for iOS, but I want to make sure that the PC/Mac version of the game takes advantage of the larger screen and different input methods. <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=745059385">If you like what you see, please take a moment to give it a thumbs up!</a>
